## 1. Choice of the base image on which to build each container.
- The client and the backend of the system both run on Nodejs version 16.18.1 and since the aim is to have a small docker image, I chose to use the alpine version, node:16.18.1-alpine which is much smaller than node:16.18.1


## 2. Dockerfile directives used in the creation and running of each container.
- FROM - specifies the base image which can be pulled from a docker    registry. In this case it was node:16.18.1-alpine
- WORKDIR - sets the current working directory
- COPY - copies local files and directories to the image
- RUN - executes commands during the build image process
- EXPOSE - specifies the port to be exposed for the Docker container
- CMD - executes the 'npm start' command in a running container

## 3. Docker-compose Networking (Application port allocation and a bridge network implementation) where necessary.
- The application has a custom bridge network  which  sets up a single network for all the applications.It was created using the command

        $ docker network create mongo_network
- This network  was then assigned to all containers in the docker compose file

## 4. Docker-compose volume definition and usage (where necessary).
- The application has a volume for persisting data generated by and used by the Docker containers. In this case the data being persisted was product data. The volume was created using the command

        $ docker volume create mongo_volume
-This volume was then allocated to all containers so that thay can have access to data that is stored by the application

## 5. Git workflow used to achieve the task.
- The commits I made outlined the steps I took to Dokcerize the application and make it functional. Below are commit logs arranged in order from most recent. They were gotten using the command 

    $ git log
